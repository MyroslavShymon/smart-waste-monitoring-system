# Smart Waste Monitoring System

An IoT-driven solution for real-time monitoring and management of waste container fill levels, powered by ultrasonic sensors, ESP32, LoRa/MQTT, and ASP.NET Core.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ultrasonic sensors on ESP32 publish fill-level data via LoRa/MQTT.  
- **Backend API**: Built with ASP.NET Core (C#) and PostgreSQL for data storage and processing.  
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive map view (Google Maps/Leaflet) showing container locations and statuses.  
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Push and in-app alerts when fill level exceeds configurable thresholds.  
- **Predictive Forecasting**: Simple regression model forecasts fill levels 1‚Äì2 days ahead.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Administrator, Dispatcher, Driver, and Engineer roles with custom permissions.  
- **Offline Resilience**: Solar-powered battery backup ensures sensor uptime in all conditions.
